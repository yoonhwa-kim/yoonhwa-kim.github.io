      <h3>Research interests</h3>
      <p>
  			My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. I am particularly interested
        in word embedding, part of network architectures for statistical language modelling, which can transform words or phrases
        from a certain corpus into vectors of real numbers for language modelling purposes. Currently, I am working on cross-lingual
        word embedding, which consists of embedding multiple languages into a single semantic space. Nonetheless, I am not
        restricted to the topics mentioned above, I enjoy working on multiple languages, or more specially, connecting
        languages and transferring resources from one language to another.

      <h3>Research Statement</h3>
      <p>
My research interest lies in the area of natural language processing (NLP) and Machine Learning where I have worked on statistical approaches and computational models to extract semantic information from text. I am particularly interested in closing the gap between commonly spoken languages like English or other European languages, for which there exist an abundance of NLP resources and technologies, and minority languages that often lack even the most basic NLP resources and tools such as Arabic and Korean.
      </p>
      <p>
During my masters, I worked at the Intelligent Information System Laboratory (<a href="http://iis.korea.ac.kr/xe/">IIS Lab</a>) as graduate assistant under the supervision of <a href="http://iis.korea.ac.kr/xe/professor">Prof. Chung In-Jeong</a>. My research area was in-between NLP and Machine Learning. In the laboratory, I was involved in several projects such as The Brain Korea 21 Plus (<a href="https://bkplus.nrf.re.kr/">BK21+</a>), a human resource development program funded by the Korean Ministry of Education. My master thesis was about retrieving snippets from search engines and embedding them using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), clustering the output vectors using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). I published a paper by the end of my master which explains how to use LSA efficiently for clustering purposes and topic analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
Early 2015, I started pursuing a doctorate in Computer Science at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under the supervision of <a href="http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/index.php/Key-Sun_Choi">Prof. Key-Sun Choi</a>. I also joined Semantic Web Research Center (<a href="http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/index.php/Home">SWRC</a>) where I worked as a graduate assistant. My research topics were focused on NLP and Semantic Web where I started building an interest in tasks that extracts/enrich information from/into Knowledge bases such as <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>. More precisely, I worked on Entity Linking which is a task that relied on a knowledge base (KB) to identify entities from a given text and then link them to their corresponding links in the KB. Most of these entities are very ambiguous, and thus they need a strong model to make sure every named entity is correctly linked using its context. I developed a model that was able to successfully find and disambiguate named entities in Korean and was even able to accomplish results that are on par with state-of-the-art models such as <a href="https://http://aksw.org/Projects/AGDISTIS.html"> AGDISTIS</a> in English. The model was part of <a href="http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/index.php/Entity_Linking">project</a> and was also used in several other applications such as <a href="http://www.okbqa.org/">OKBQA</a>, <a href="http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/index.php/DBpedia_Korea"> DBpedia Korea</a> and several <a href="http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/index.php/Research"> others</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
On the second year of my doctorate, I decided to shift my focus to a less application oriented laboratory and thus I have joined the Users and information Laboratory (<a href="http://uilab.kr/">U&I Lab</a>) under the supervision of <a href="http://uilab.kaist.ac.kr/members/aliceoh/">Prof. Alice Oh</a>. My current research topic are multi-lingual word embedding and its application to other NLP tasks such as cross-lingual transfer. Recently, I have been working on an idea that combines traditional embedding methods such as Dice Aligner and current state-of-the-art methods such as Word2Vec to come up with a better representation for multi-lingual embeddings. I am also using my work to collaborate with other researchers to work on different tasks such as topic analysis. One of the current collaborations involves clustering political tweets from three different languages (English, French, and German) and then analyze the results to identify politicians that have similar/opposite point of views.
      </p>
      <p>
Finally, my goal is to develop or improve new techniques that could serve as a bridge between different languages, especially the less fortunate languages that are lacking in research development. Such type of transfer can help a lot of NLP tasks ranging from machine translation to all sort of other NLP tasks that rely on a multi-lingual environment.
